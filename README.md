# Churn Prediction Project

This project aims to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company using data analysis and machine learning techniques. The project utilizes several Python libraries, including pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, docker, pipenv, and AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

## Data

The dataset used in this project contains information about customers, including their demographic data, services subscribed, and monthly charges. The dataset was preprocessed using pandas and numpy to handle missing values and encode categorical variables.

## Model

The project uses a logistic regression model to predict customer churn. The model was trained using scikit-learn and evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Deployment

The project was deployed to AWS Elastic Beanstalk using Docker and pipenv. The deployment process was automated using AWS CodePipeline and AWS CodeBuild.

## Usage

To use this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies using pipenv. Then, run the main.py file to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance. To deploy the project to AWS Elastic Beanstalk, follow the instructions in the deployment folder.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of data analysis and machine learning techniques to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company. The project also showcases the use of various Python libraries and deployment tools, including pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, Docker, pipenv, and AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
